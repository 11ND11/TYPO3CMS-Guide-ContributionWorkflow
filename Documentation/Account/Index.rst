========================
Setting up your Accounts
========================

So let's go over this step by step.

Your TYPO3.org account will be used for a variety of services that you will use throughout the TYPO3 project.

In this guide we will deal with those involved in the contribution process which will be:

* Forge_, our **Issue Tracker** based on Redmine
* Gerrit_, our **Code Review** System:
* Slack, which is used for general communication. Read the 
  :ref:`section about Slack in the introduction <slack-intro>` 
  and `register for TYPO3's Slack Workspace 
  <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`, if you have not done so already.

So let's go over the two accounts you need to set up in order to contribute code:
