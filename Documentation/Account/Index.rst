========================
Setting up your Accounts
========================

Your TYPO3.org account will be used to access a variety of services that sit within the TYPO3 project.

This guide will focus on the services required to take part in the contribution process:

* Forge_, our **Issue Tracker** based on Redmine'
* Gerrit_, our **Code Review** System:
* Slack, which is used for general communication. Read the 
  :ref:`section about Slack in the introduction <slack-intro>` 
  and `register <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ 
  for TYPO3's Slack Workspace, if you have not done so already.

So let's go over the two accounts you need to set up in order to contribute code:
