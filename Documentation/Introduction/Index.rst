General recommendations for contribution
========================================

In general: If you wish to make a contribution, familiarize yourself with the basics and general conventions used. In
Open-source projects it is usually mandatory that your code must follow the general coding guidelines for the
project and that your commit messages either follow general recommendations for commit messages or use specific
constraints for the project.

Some github projects have a contribution guide available, the TYPO3 CMS project has this guide.

If in doubt, ask on slack. Other contributors will be happy to help you.
