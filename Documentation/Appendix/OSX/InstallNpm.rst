==================
NPM install on OSX
==================

Head over to https://nodejs.org and download the OSX installer. It will detect your operating system version and will
give you the right downloads right off the bat.

Once you have installed it, you can open up the Terminal app which is located under Applications/Utilities on your mac.
Once in the terminal, type ``npm -v`` to get the version number of NPM that is currently running on your machine.
