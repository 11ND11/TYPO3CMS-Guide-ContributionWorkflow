Introduction to Forge
=====================

The issue tracker Forge is currently based on Redmine. It is used to
report and handle open issues (including bugs and feature requests).
You need to set up an account first, see
:ref:`TYPO3-Guide-ContributionWorkflow-Account`.

When you want to report a bug, you need to go to the
`"Issues" section for the TYPO3 Core
<https://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3cms-core/issues>`__.
