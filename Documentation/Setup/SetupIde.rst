Coding Guidelines
===================

Make sure your IDE is setup properly to comply with the :ref:`Coding Guidelines for TYPO3 (CGL) <t3coreapi:cgl>`. For
example, (following PSR-2) space characters (not tabs) are used to indent source code. See
:ref:`Whitespace and indentation <t3coreapi:cgl-general-requirements-for-php-files>` for more information.
