Introduction
============

This guide provides all necessary information to enable you to contribute to the TYPO3 
source code. 

The main focus is submitting patches (to fix bugs or add new features) to the TYPO3 source 
code, but you will also find information for :ref:`writing bug reports <bugreporting-index>`, 
:ref:`adding documentation <Adding-documentation>`, :ref:`running tests <testing>`, 
:ref:`reviewing and testing patches <lifeOfAPatch>` etc.

How this guide is structured
============================

The guide is structured in a way to give you all necessary information **in the order
that you need it.** This means you can read it from the beginning and use it as a 
hands on guide, performing the steps as you go along. 

The further you go along, the more advanced the topics will become.

But, you can also use it as a reference guide and jump straight to a section you
are looking for. In this case, use the search box to search for what
you are looking for or browse through the menu. 

Some pages near the end of the manual assume that you are already familiar with 
contributing and serve as reference pages, for example the 
:ref:`git cheat sheet <cheat-sheet-git>` or the
:ref:`Quickstart: Creating a patch <core-contrib-quickstart>` page for a terse
overview of all steps involved in creating a patch.

Some of the information, that is too extensive for the main guide, is found in 
the :ref:`appendix`. 

Additional information
======================

In general: If you wish to make a contribution, familiarize yourself with 
the basics and general conventions used. For the TYPO3 source it is  
mandatory that your code must follow the general 
:ref:`coding guidelines <t3coreapi:cgl>` for the
project and that your commit messages follow the 
:ref:`commit messages rules <commitmessage>`.

When developing, you will also want to be well informed about the
latest developments in the TYPO3 core. For additional
information, look here:

* `Core ChangeLog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/>`__
* :ref:`Core API <t3coreapi:start>`
