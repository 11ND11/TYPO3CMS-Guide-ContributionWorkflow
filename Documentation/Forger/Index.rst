We manage most of the work in the TYPO3 project via a tool called Forger_, which is basically a read-only view on issue
and reviews.

So Forger_ does a few things for us

#. Provide a decent **search** over issues on Forge_, available via the huge search box on the start page and in the top right
   corner.

#. Visualize the current development with a lot of useful **graphs**. You can learn more about the graphs
   `here <https://forger.typo3.org/standard/help>`_.

#. Show and filter **reviews** incl. filters to easily find things to review. Check out the ``Reviews`` menu.

#. Offer a variety of Kanban-style boards both for **issues** and **reviews**. Btw, this is a great way to follow the
   current development. Just put up any board on a huge screen and use an auto-reload plugin in your browser. Take a look
   at the ``Sprints`` menu.

#. Supply an **Issue Management** view to show issues aggregated by year, month and status, based on their last update.

#. A **rst file generator** which is useful when you add documentation snippets to a review.
