Slack
=====


If you wish to contribute, joining the `TYPO3 slack workspace <https://typo3.slack.com>`__ is 
recommended as it is the projects chosen platform for communication. In order to join the slack workspace, you
must create a `typo3.org <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=2>`__ account and then  `Register 
for TYPO3's Slack Platform <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__. On that page, you will also find 
information about recomended channels.

.. hint::
   You will need a typo3.org account for contribution anyway in order to use Forge and Gerrit.

Slack channels
--------------

* **#typo3-cms-coredev** is your channel of choice for core development 
* **#typo3-cms** is for general support issues
* **#random** if you are not sure which channel to use or have a general question


You do not need to ask for permission when asking a question. Ask your question directly
in the channel and wait for a response.


As always, make sure to follow the `Code of conduct <https://typo3.org/community/code-of-conduct/>`__
or the short form: **be nice, be helpful!**


.. _botty:

Botty on Slack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also checkout the help page on `"Botty" <https://wiki.typo3.org/T3Bot>`__, the TYPO3 slack bot. We will show you
some of its commands later in this manual.

You cannot use Botty in your private channel or in a direct messaging channel with someone else. Botty will
only be available in a public channel, to which it has been invited (which is the case in #typo3-cms-coredev).


.. _general-recommendations-contributions:

General recommendations for contribution
========================================

In general: If you wish to make a contribution, familiarize yourself with the basics and general conventions used. In
Open-source projects it is usually mandatory that your code must follow the general coding guidelines for the
project and that your commit messages either follow general recommendations for commit messages or use specific
constraints for the project.

Some github projects have a contribution guide available, the TYPO3 CMS project has this guide.

If in doubt, ask on slack. Other contributors will be happy to help you.


.. _other-resources-for-contribution:

Other ways to contribute
========================

Besides developing for the TYPO3 core, there are many other ways to contribute and help the TYPO3 community.

You can find general information here:

* General information about the various `Teams & Committes <https://typo3.org/teams-committees/>`__
* General information on how you can `Participate <https://typo3.org/participate/>`__
