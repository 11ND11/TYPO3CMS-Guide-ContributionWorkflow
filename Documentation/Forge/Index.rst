Working with the Issue Tracker
==============================

So you found a bug in TYPO3 (who would have thought there are any?) and want to report it right away? **Great**.


This chapter will guide you through it step by step.


Introduction to Forge
=====================

The issue tracker Forge  is currently based on Redmine. It is used to report and handle open issues (including bugs
and feature requests). You need to set up an account first, see :ref:`TYPO3-Guide-ContributionWorkflow-Account`.

When you want to report a bug, you need to go to the
`"Issues" section for the TYPO3 Core <https://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3cms-core/issues>`__.

Searching for existing bugs
===========================

Before you want to report a bug, you may want to search through the existing issues, to see if any related issues
or even the exact same problem has already been reported.

In order to do this, you can use Forger to search and narrow down your search by using the filters on the left.
