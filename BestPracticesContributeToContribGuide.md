## Structure and Chapter / section headers

* all titles should be self-explanatory, dynamic and void subchapter headings should be avoided
* Focus on the task, not the tool: What does the person reading want to do next?
* Structure each page / section which involves several steps into steps, see #77



## Images

* All images get a white border of 10px (in the image) and an additional border / box-shadow 
  by ReST
* Screenshots should be minimal and relevant areas pointed out by boxes, markers with numbers or arrows 
* all images are placed in an _assets subdirectory
